#### Adding event filters

You might want to filter down the events that trigger a push. You use the optional filter entry for this.
If no filter is added then every event will trigger a push notification. If you add one (or more) events then ONLY those events will trigger the notification.

To use them, add the filters separated with a comma for example: task.create,task.move.column

The following events can be added to the filter:

* *task.move.column* - Move a task to another column
* *task.update* - Task modification
* *task.create* - Task creation
* *task.open* - Reopen a task
* *task.close* - Closing a task
* *task.assignee_change* - Task assignee change
* *task.move.swimlane* - Move a task to another swimlane
